\chapter{Introduction}

The `cloud' is a system of on-demand computer system resources like storage
and computing power. In general, these cloud systems are large data centers
which provide services to many users over the internet. Because computer
hardware is expensive and has a short lifespan, these data centers are often
owned by large specialized companies and sold on-demand.

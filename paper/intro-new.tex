The cloud is everywhere. All companies in the tech big 5, i.e. Facebook,
Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, use the cloud extensively and offer many cloud
services to their users. Movies are not bought anymore, but streamed. New
MacBooks do not come with much storage, instead buyers get some storage in the
Apple cloud. But how are the movies and pictures stored in the cloud? What
even is the cloud? In this thesis it is shown that the cloud is a network of
many computers. These computers need to be managed, which is done by
schedulers. Efficient schedulers are very useful, because this means that using
cloud services becomes more efficient. In this thesis we look at how methods
for improving this efficiency can be selected.

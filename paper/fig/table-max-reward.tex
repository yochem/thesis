    \caption{The time it takes to converge to the maximal average reward
    (-6.8). The time is expressed as the number of iterations and the real
    (sometimes called wallclock) time. An experiment of 2000 iterations took
    255 minutes and 10 seconds (15310 seconds). The time to converge thus is
    calculated using the following formula: $\protect it / 2000 \cdot 15310$.}
